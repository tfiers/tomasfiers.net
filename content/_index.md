## Hi

I am an engineer working in neuroscience research, 
where I apply maths and write software.
I like to make music and to dance (_e.g._ [balfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfolk)).

Questions I often think about: 

{{% /sidepic %}}

- What do tools look like that work well
with the natural curiosity of kids and researchers?

- How can we distill and represent ideas as intuitively as possible?
Both when researching others' ideas, as when sharing our own.

- What is good interface design?


I am currently working on a PhD in computational neuroscience
with [Mark Humphries](https://www.humphries-lab.org/)
at the University of Nottingham.
Neuroscientists can film precise voltages of individual neurons in living animals.
We wonder how we can use such data to infer the wiring between those neurons.
We could then construct connectomes _in vivo_.

[This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/FryqOCMyByA) is a short presentation about the work, made a while back.

You are welcome to read one of my [posts](/posts), or check out some
of the things I built under [projects](/projects).



## Education

I have a bachelor's in computer science and electrical engineering, and a 
master's in [biomedical engineering](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_51360389.htm) (specialization: signal processing),
both from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).

I did my [master's thesis](https://tomasfiers.net/projects/#masters-thesis-machine-learning-for-neuroscience-researchers) 
in a systems neuroscience [lab](https://www.nerf.be/research/nerf-labs/fabian-kloosterman), 
and filled my master's with [electives](https://tomasfiers.net/projects/#electives-i-took-in-my-masters) 
in data analysis, neuroscience, and machine learning.
