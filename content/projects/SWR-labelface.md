The signals I had to detect for my master's thesis were not clearly defined –
there is no ground truth for them. I therefore made a [web
interface](https://tfiers.github.io/labelface) for the neuroscientists in the
lab, to label potential events. Tech: Vue.js, Node.js, mongodb, Bootstrap,
Heroku, and the scientific Python stack for data processing and plot generation.
GitHub repo's for [frontend](https://github.com/tfiers/labelface), and
[backend](https://github.com/tfiers/labelback).

⚠️ NOTE: the free service on which the backend was hosted has gone bankrupt; so the full interface won't load anymore, alas.
