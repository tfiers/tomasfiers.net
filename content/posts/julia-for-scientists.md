I gave a presentation on the programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org),
for my uni's Psychology department.

- When should you use it over Python / Matlab / Excel?
- What are Julia's strengths?
- ..and current weaknesses?
- Plus some practical tips, learned from experience

Here are the slides:

</a>
 
(The presentation starts at a basic level, but quickly goes into more nerdy terrain;
The audience was varied, hence the different registers).

There is a discussion of these slides on the Julia Discourse forum,
[here](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-for-scientists-summary-slides/91397?u=tfiers).
