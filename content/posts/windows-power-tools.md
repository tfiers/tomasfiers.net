This is a running collection of tools I use to make Windows good.


### Beeftext (text snippets)
- [beeftext.org](https://beeftext.org) | [github](https://github.com/xmichelo/Beeftex)
- C++, modern GUI (Qt5), active development
- Great UX

What I use it for (i.e. things I'm tired of typing over and over)
- To make images less huge on github: `<img width=400 src="â€¦">`


### WinCompose (keyboard shortcuts for special characters)
- [wincompose.info](http://wincompose.info/) | [github](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose)
- C#, active development
- Kinda wonky UI, but works
- Supports the [.XCompose] format from the linux world.
  - [My `.XCompose` file](https://github.com/tfiers/dotfiles/blob/main/.XCompose)
- Big advantage over e.g. Julia's great `\alpha<tab>`-completion
  (see first "Julia likes" slide in {{< ref "julia-for-scientists" >}}):
  available in every text field in every app.
